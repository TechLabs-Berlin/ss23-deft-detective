All of us have lost important items in our lives and had absolutely no idea where to start looking for them! That's what Deft Detective is for, the mobile app that helps you find them back! The application generates an email to all the places (like bars, restaurants, coffe places, shops and so on) where you have been in a certain period of time and asks them if the object has been found! Three easy steps make the search quicker and more effective: 1. name and describe the object, 2. give the time window, 3. specify the approximate location drawing a polygon on a map. No registration needed, an email address is enough to continue the communication with the businesses, which will reply confirming or denying the finding, also via email.
